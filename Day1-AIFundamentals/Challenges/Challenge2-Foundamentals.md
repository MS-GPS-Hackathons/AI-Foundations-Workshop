# Challenge 2: Deploy an GenAI Enterprise Chat web app

 [< Previous Challenge](./Challenge1-Foundamentas.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge3-Foundamentals.md)


## Introduction
After setting up a hub and a project in Azure AI Studio, the next essential step is to deploy and thoroughly test the model with and without your data. Deploying the model makes it accessible for various applications, while testing ensures its performance meets the desired standards before integrating it into a production environment such as a web application.

## Success Criteria

- Confirm that your chosen chat completions model is deployed and ready to handle requests even without your own data.
- Verify that you successfully added your data to the deployed chat model in Azure AI Studio.
- Ensure that you tested the chat model using your data, and it responded accurately to queries relevant to that data.
- Validate that you deployed the chat model as a web application in Azure.
- Confirm that you configured authentication for the web app, restricting access to users within your Azure tenant.
- Verify that you tested the deployed web app, ensuring it uses your data to generate responses.
